Plex Home Automation

Connect a Plex Server or a Plex Player to your Hue or any other connected device. The configuration needs to be done in code and then compiled. Once i find time I will create a config UI.
I used it to turn off the light (Philips Hue and LAN-Enabled Power Device) once a movie starts and vice versa.
